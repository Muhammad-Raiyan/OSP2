Implemented FIFO, LRU and second schance page replacement algorithm
Calculated total no of page faults in implementation of each of these algorithms and itâ€™s present in log files.

We performed two performance analysis in this module-
a.)Comparison of LRU and FIFO in terms of total no. of page faults
b.)Page fault comparison for FIFO and LRU Algorithms when frame size is varied

We have appended results of these experiments in our report.
