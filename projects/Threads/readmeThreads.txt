OSP-2 Project - "Threads"
Group-4

This module is responsible for creating, killing, dispatching, suspending, and resuming threads, the fundamental units of execution in OSP2

Implemented Round Robin, FCFS, Priority-driven preemptive scheduling and multi-level feedback queue algorithm
Calculated response time, throughput and turnaround time in implementation of each of these algorithms and itâ€™s present in log files.

We performed four performance analysis in this module-
a.)Comparison of RR and FCFS in terms of CPU utilization
b.)Peformance of RR and FCFS in case of short thread and long thread
c.)RR throughput ratio vs Time slice
d.)Comparison of RR, FCFS, priority driven and multi-level feedback queue scheduling

We have appended results of these experiments in our report.
